Afterwards, we will tackle the full pipeline once again, using new knowledge from our lectures to solve a more tricky task, i.e., general/non-binary classification. In particular, we will be using the CIFAR10 dataset that you developed in exercise 3, though we have to make some changes on the optimization and loss side, in comparison to your toy example in exercise 4. \n",
